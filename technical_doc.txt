 Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on New Delhi house
price data, analyzing feature distributions, class balance, skewness, and outliers
using statistical summaries and visualizations.
 Performed univariate and multivariate analysis to identify key relationships between
housing attributes and sale prices, informing feature engineering and modeling
decisions.
 Executed data preprocessing pipeline, including:
       Encoding categorical and ordinal features using appropriate encoding
        strategies.
       Handling outliers and data inconsistencies
       Applying log transformation on the target variable (price) to address extreme
        skewness and stabilize variance
 Trained and evaluated multiple tree-based regression models (Decision Tree, Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting) and performed comparative model selection.
 Finalized Gradient Boosting Regressor as the best model, achieving:
       RMSE: 0.25
       R² Score: 0.66 on unseen test data
 Serialized the trained model using Pickle (PKL) for production deployment.
 Developed a RESTful backend API using FastAPI to serve real-time predictions from the
trained model.
 Built an interactive frontend application using Streamlit for user-friendly house price
prediction.
 Implemented Docker-based containerization and deployed the system using a hybrid
deployment approach:
       Backend deployed on Railway
       Frontend deployed on Streamlit Cloud
